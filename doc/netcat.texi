@c man begin DESCRIPTION
Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network
connections, using TCP or UDP protocol.
It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly
or easily driven by other programs and scripts.  At the same time, it is
a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
built-in capabilities.  Netcat, or "nc" as the original program was named,
should have been supplied long ago as another one of those cryptic but
standard Unix tools.

@node Invoking, The Connect Mode, Overview, Top
@chapter Invoking
@cindex invoking

@c man begin DESCRIPTION
Netcat has three main modes of functionality.  These are the connect mode,
the listen mode, and the tunnel mode.

The most common mode is the connect mode, which for example allows the output
of a locally called command to be redirected for example to a remote Netcat
listening or to any other kind of daemon waiting for a connection.

On the other hand, the listen mode can be used to obtain some kind of stream
of data from a remote site.

The most new feature is the tunnel mode, which is a powerful and reliable
mode that allows tunneling a remote site towards any other remote site,
allowing to specify for example from which interface create the connection
and from which port.

@section Basic Startup Options

@table @samp
@item -V
@itemx --version
Display the version of Netcat and exit.

@item -h
@itemx --help
Print a help message describing most common Netcat's command-line switches and
a short description.

@item -v
@itemx --verbose
Prints status messages, usually needed for using Netcat as user front-end.  All
messages are printed to stderr in order not to affect the data stream.

Use this option double to get more messages.

@node Protocol and Interface Options, Advanced Options, Basic Startup Options, Invoking
@section Protocol and Interface Options

@table @samp
@item -t
@itemx --tcp
Use the TCP protocol. this is the default.  It may be useful (see Tunnel Mode)
to specify this option after for example the UDP option in order to allow a
cross-tunneling between TCP and UDP.

@item -u
@itemx --udp
Use the UDP protocol. see TCP.

@item -p NUM
@itemx --local-port=NUM
@c that "listen mode" must be a link
Selects the local port.  In listen mode and tunnel mode, it specifies which
port to use for listening, while in connect mode it specifies the source
port (the port from which originating the connection).

If this option is not specified, the OS will assign a random available port.

@table @samp
@item -i SECS
@itemx --interval SECS
sets the buffering output delay time. This affects all the current modes and
makes the connection sock to buffer outgoing data. this means that in tunnel
mode everything received from the listening socket is buffered for the connect
socket.

@item -r
@itemx --randomize
randomizes the target remote ports ranges.  If more than one range is
specified it will randomize the ports in the whole range.

@item -w
@itemx --wait=SECS

@item -T
@itemx --telnet
Answers the telnet codes as described in the RFC 0854.  With this option, the
incoming telnet codes are parsed inside the receiving queue and are stripped
off as they were never received (unless it was compiled with --enable-compat
or with --enable-oldtelnet).

@chapter The Connect Mode
@cindex connect
In the connect mode, Netcat connects to a remote host and simply links
his stdin and stdout to the remote data stream.

Basic usage is:

netcat [options] hostname ports @dots{}

The specified ports indicates actually all ports to connect to.  With
normal operations Netcat will sequentially (or randomly, if you specified
the `-r' option) connect to all the specified ports and links stdin/stdout.
No more than one port is used at once.

Particular options:
In this mode, the `-p' option specifies the source port for connection, but
it should never be specified unless you know what you are doing. The `-w'
(timeout) option specifies how long to wait for the connection to succeed
(if the remote host connects but doesn't send any data, the timeout DOESN'T
apply).

@node The Listen Mode, The Tunnel Mode, The Connect Mode, Top
@chapter The Listen Mode
@cindex listen

In listen mode, Netcat stays idle listening on a port, specified by the `-p'
switch, until some remote host connects. At this point, the basic behaviour
is the same of the connect mode.

Basic usage is:

netcat -l -p port [remote_hostname] [remote_ports] @dots{}

The remote hostname specifies which host is allowed to connect and from which
ports. Usually these parameters are not specified, but if you want to sort
out a special connection.
