@c man begin DESCRIPTION
Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network
connections, using TCP or UDP protocol.
It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly
or easily driven by other programs and scripts.  At the same time, it is
a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
built-in capabilities.  Netcat, or "nc" as the original program was named,
should have been supplied long ago as another one of those cryptic but
standard Unix tools.
