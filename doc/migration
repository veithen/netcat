* 1.  Introduction to the migration from nc110 to GNU Netcat

  ...



* 2.  Main differences with nc110



* 2.1.  Important uncompatibilities and possible solutions

   o The hexdump output style (the option activated with -o filename), is
     different.  My new style has a better readability and it is more
     standard.  The configure option `--enable-oldhexdump' is provided in
     order to allows total backward compatibility to scripts that for example
     automatically parse the output file.



* 2.2.  Fixes and additions

   o Now the command line switch `-n' (numeric) applies only for DNS hostname
     lookups and portnames are still resolved normally even if a `-n' is given.
     There is no backward compatibility for this issue, and that is because
     there are actually no reasons to disallow port names lookups.

   o Source (local) port is no longer randomly-generated while connecting or
     listening without port specification (-p), but rather it is
     randomly-assigned by the OS (actually the OS assigns the ports
     sequentially but we don't care, there are no reasons for randomizing
     source ports.  If you really need to use a random port then force it
     with the `-p' option.

   o The random (-r) option issued with different ranges now randomizes each
     port in the whole space instead of randomizing inside each given range.
     There is no backward compatibility support for this.

   o When a port range is specified, runs throught the range from lowest
     number to the highest, while nc110 runs throught the hightest to
     the lowest number.

   o The timeout system was broken for port-scanning or multiple ports
     connections (it applied only for the first attempt).



* 3. What's new in the new core 0.3.0

   o Fixed the delayed sending not displaying incoming data immediately (there
     was no reason to hold the data in the socket while buffering outgoing
     data).

   o It randomizes the target ports in the whole selected range rather than the
     single sub-ranges given on the command line.
