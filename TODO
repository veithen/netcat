The GNU Netcat project.

    TODO/bugs in Netcat
==============================

 o Write the README file!

 o I need to study deeply the -g/-G options issue in order to make
   it working properly.

 o make install should also symlink nc -> netcat

 o Add command line switch -X, --input-hexdump so that read from
   stdin some valid hexdump-style data, and accepts it in some
   standard forms (more than one)

 o I need to fetch information about the history of this tool,
   so I can give credits to the right people for the design and
   the original code.

 o It would be nice to add IPv6 support, maybe a command line
   switch like `-6'.

 o If some more critical uncompatibilities will jump out, add
   a configure option `--enable-compat' that implies ALL other
   single options like `--enable-oldhexdump'.

 o The configure script must properly check res_init() by including
   the <resolv.h> file.

 o Make it compiling on SunOS. It requires -lsocket -lnsl -lresolv.
