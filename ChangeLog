[*] Mon Apr 29 2002 - netcat (cvs)

  o Various fixes to the Makefiles for the clean targets
  o Fixed --enable-debug configure parameter
  o Added configure option `--enable-oldhexdump', causes netcat to use the
    old hexdump style rather than my new style.


[*] Mon Apr 29 2002 - netcat v0.2.0

  o Changed the define HINF to typedef netcat_host.
  o Removed comparehosts() function.
  o Removed gethostpoop() function.
  o Fixed some warnings.
  o Added file network.c, containing function netcat_resolvehost(), which is
    the equivalent of the old gethostpoop().
  o Added debug() and debug_v() routines, to improve debugging output.
    Debug() is now obsolete and will be removed soon.
  o Added file proto.h, containing all externs and function declarations.
  o Changed some global variable names and types
  o Added function netcat_fhexdump() which substitutes the old oprint()
    function.  Removed some unused global variables.
  o Added command line switch `-x' (hexdump). Switch `-o' implies `-x'.
  o Added command line switch `-V' (version).
  o Added function netcat_getport() which substitutes the old getportpoop().
    Updated references to the function and related struct.


[*] Sun Apr 28 2002 - netcat v0.1.0

  o Great cleanup of the original source files, this will be the base for the
    rewrite.
  o Rewrote command line reader from stdin (dynamically rebuilds argv based on
    the input string.
  o Added functions netcat_string_split() and netcat_commandline().
