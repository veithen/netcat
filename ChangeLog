[*] Fri May 17 2002 - netcat (cvs)

  o Fixed the udp mode listen, which didn't allow any kind of safe read from
    stdin.


[*] Wed May 15 2002 - netcat v0.4.0

  o Now netcat_socket_accept() recognizes a negative timeout parameter.
  o Splitted core functions like readwrite() to core.c, this allows a more
    modular programming and allows a better features-implementation.
  o Moved some low level code from main.c to core.c
  o Added UDP protocol support, but it is a little buggy still, because I have
    got some logistic problems to solve before fixing the implementation.
  o Fixed various socket leaks.
  o Reimplemented command line switch `-z' for TCP protocol.
  o Handled the listen mode-zero I/O case situation.
  o Port ranges now are recognized even in the form min:max
  o Fixed a bug in core_tcp_connect(), which didn't handle properly socket
    connection failures on very fast hosts (such as localhost).
  o Rewritten telnet support.  Now we have a more reliable implementation of
    the RFC0854.  Netcat will also rewrite the incoming buffer with the telnet
    codes stripped.
  o Updated doc/migration with new uncompatibilities found.
  o Added configure option `--enable-oldtelnet', which restores the old nc110
    telnet codes parsing policy.
  o Added configure option `--enable-compat', which turnes on ALL the other
    backwards compatibility switches.
  o Cleanup of the main header file and to the global environment.
  o First beta release!


[*] Thu May  9 2002 - netcat v0.3.1

  o Now "make install" also symlinks "nc" to the program file "netcat".
  o More careful use of stderr/stdout for printing messages
  o Updated file doc/migration
  o Now it is possible to force the local source port when connecting to
    somewhere using the -p option (this is not yet possible in tunnel mode).
  o Fixed some output messages in netcat.c


[*] Mon May  6 2002 - netcat v0.3.0

  o Fixed netcat_resolvehost() to be more library function.
  o Added function netcat_socket_new() to network.c
  o Added functions netcat_socket_new_listen() and netcat_socket_accept()
    to network.c
  o configure now checks for important gettext external data.
  o Updated files INSTALL and COPYING
  o Added function netcat_inet_ntop() to network.c
  o Fixed backwards incompatibility in netcat_fhexdump()
  o Added file doc/migration.
  o Fully rewrote the core part of the project.  The new core has total async
    I/O support and is totally select() based.  It also introduces a new
    command line arguments parsing style.  See the doc/migration file for more
    information.
  o Fixed the delayed (-i) output sending not displaying incoming data
    immediately.
  o Verbose messages are now printed automatically in debug mode.
  o Changed copyrighter name
  o Added command line switch `-L', activates the tunnel mode to the host and
    port specified on the command line.
  o Added function netcat_inet_pton() to network.c
  o Added function ncprint() to misc.c, this allows a more powerful output
    management and a more readability of the source code.
  o Lots of fixes and improvements for portability


[*] Wed May  1 2002 - netcat v0.2.2

  o More fixes around the NLS (added the missing config.rpath script)
  o Added lib directory that will contain all netcat related libraries.
  o Added compatibility support (libcontrib) containing all the needed
    functions not provided by the OS.
  o Added GNU getopt to the compat library.
  o More changes to the netcat_getport() function. Now it should catch every
    kind of invalid input safely.


[*] Tue Apr 30 2002 - netcat v0.2.1

  o Various fixes to the Makefiles for the clean targets
  o Fixed --enable-debug configure parameter
  o Added configure option `--enable-oldhexdump', causes netcat to use the
    old hexdump style rather than my new style.
  o Added macros debug_d and debug_dv, respectively debug plus delay and
    debug verbose plus delay.  Removed the old Debug macro.
  o Restored command line switch `-w' (wait).
  o Rewrote (again) netcat_resolvehost(), this time it's a little more
    abstracted.
  o Removed libtool support (it wasn't really needed at the moment)
  o Added Native Language Support to the project
  o Added the first traslation file (italian)


[*] Mon Apr 29 2002 - netcat v0.2.0

  o Changed the define HINF to typedef netcat_host.
  o Removed comparehosts() function.
  o Removed gethostpoop() function.
  o Fixed some warnings.
  o Added file network.c, containing function netcat_resolvehost(), which is
    the equivalent of the old gethostpoop().
  o Added debug() and debug_v() routines, to improve debugging output.
    Debug() is now obsolete and will be removed soon.
  o Added file proto.h, containing all externs and function declarations.
  o Changed some global variable names and types
  o Added function netcat_fhexdump() which substitutes the old oprint()
    function.  Removed some unused global variables.
  o Added command line switch `-x' (hexdump). Switch `-o' implies `-x'.
  o Added command line switch `-V' (version).
  o Added function netcat_getport() which substitutes the old getportpoop().
    Updated references to the function and related struct.


[*] Sun Apr 28 2002 - netcat v0.1.0

  o Great cleanup of the original source files, this will be the base for the
    rewrite.
  o Rewrote command line reader from stdin (dynamically rebuilds argv based on
    the input string.
  o Added functions netcat_string_split() and netcat_commandline().
